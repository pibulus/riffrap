## What is this?

Riff Rap is a web app for snapping down lyrics from your voice â€” line by line, riff by riff.  
You talk, mumble, freestyle, rant â€” whatever gets the spark going.

As the words come out, they land in a text box. If something hits, you **grab** it. If it doesn't, you **re-roll**. If you collect enough good ones, you can rearrange them, edit, and copy or download the result.

It's especially good for when you're half-singing, half-thinking â€” testing ideas, rhythms, phrasing.  
Even when you're just mumbling gibberish, Riff Rap tries to **meet you halfway**.  
It fills in the gaps, makes sense of the nonsense, and helps you catch what was almost there.

It's not about getting it right. It's about getting it *out*.

## What it does

- ðŸ”µ Turns your vocal gibberish into usable lyric ideas  
- ðŸŸ£ Snap the lines that feel good  
- ðŸŸ¢ Re-roll the ones that don't until they make sense  
- ðŸŸ¡ Test rhythms, flows, and melodies without committing  
- ðŸŸ  Rearrange, edit, compile, and export when it's feeling right  

That's it. No more, no less. It gets out of your way.

## Why?

Because mumble-to-meaningful is where the magic happens.  
Because sometimes you need to make a mess to find the line.  
Because your best vocal ideas often come from half-formed thoughts and rhythms.

It's a bridge between your voice's raw energy and words that actually work.

## How it works

1. **Speak** â€” Mumble, freestyle, or just make sounds with rhythm
2. **Snap** â€” Riff Rap intelligently interprets your vocal patterns
3. **Refine** â€” Keep re-rolling until the gibberish becomes gold
4. **Arrange** â€” Drag, edit, and compile your best lines
5. **Export** â€” Take your lyrics anywhere

The rougher, the better â€” Riff Rap thrives on turning vocal chaos into lyrical order.
