# EventBridge.js - Structural Assessment

## Service Overview

The EventBridge service provides a standardized way to handle events in the application, maintaining consistent naming conventions across all LineSnap features. It's a crucial infrastructure service that enables cross-component communication without tight coupling.

## Glam Zones Identified

### GLAM ZONE 1: CONSTANTS AND UTILITIES
**Lines:** ~35-75
**Purpose:** Define constants and utility functions for event handling
**Contents:**
- Event name prefix constants
- Utility functions for event name normalization
- String processing helpers

**Dependencies:**
- None (self-contained)

**Optimization Notes:**
- String utilities could be moved to a shared utility module

### GLAM ZONE 2: EVENT DISPATCHING
**Lines:** ~80-165
**Purpose:** Provide functions to dispatch events throughout the application
**Contents:**
- Setting change event dispatching
- Application event dispatching
- Event format standardization
- Legacy event support

**Dependencies:**
- Utilities from GLAM ZONE 1

**Optimization Notes:**
- Legacy event support could be controlled by a feature flag for future removal

### GLAM ZONE 3: EVENT LISTENING
**Lines:** ~169-286
**Purpose:** Provide functions to listen for events with proper cleanup
**Contents:**
- Setting change listeners
- Application event listeners
- Automatic cleanup functions
- Event filtering helpers

**Dependencies:**
- Utilities from GLAM ZONE 1
- Browser DOM APIs

**Optimization Notes:**
- Could implement an event bus pattern for more complex routing

### GLAM ZONE 4: PUBLIC API INTERFACE
**Lines:** ~290-344
**Purpose:** Export a clean public API
**Contents:**
- Event dispatching functions
- Event listening functions
- Constants and types

**Dependencies:**
- All previous zones

**Optimization Notes:**
- API could be simplified with method chaining for improved fluency

## Future Extraction Candidates

1. **EventNameHandler**: Extract naming and normalization logic
2. **LegacyEventBridge**: Extract legacy event compatibility to a separate module
3. **EventBusFacade**: Add a more sophisticated event routing system

## OMG REF (App Glam-Up)
The eventBridge is well-structured but contains legacy compatibility code that could be better isolated for future removal. The service already follows a clean module pattern that makes it a good example for other services.
