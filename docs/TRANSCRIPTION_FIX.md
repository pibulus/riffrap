# Audio Transcription Fix

## Issue
The app was failing to display transcription text in the UI after completing audio transcription. The API was successfully generating transcription, but it wasn't appearing in the text box.

## Root Cause
A circular state dependency created a feedback loop between components:

1. `TranscriptDisplay.svelte` had a bidirectional binding with the transcript data:
   ```js
   // Bidirectional data binding creates circular dependency
   transcriptStore.subscribe(value => (transcript = value));
   $: transcriptStore.set(transcript);
   ```

2. This created a race condition where state updates from the transcription service were fighting with local component updates.

## Fix
Applied a one-way data flow architecture:

1. Added direct subscription in `TranscriptDisplay_Core.js` to ensure state flows from global to local:
   ```js
   transcriptionText.subscribe(text => {
     if (text && text !== get(transcriptStore)) {
       transcriptStore.set(text);
     }
   });
   ```

2. Removed bidirectional binding in `TranscriptDisplay.svelte`:
   ```js
   // Removed: transcriptStore.subscribe(value => (transcript = value));
   // Removed: $: transcriptStore.set(transcript);
   ```

## Key Lesson
Reactive frameworks like Svelte require careful state management. Bidirectional data binding can cause subtle race conditions when multiple components try to update the same state. One-way data flow provides more predictable behavior by establishing a clear source of truth.
